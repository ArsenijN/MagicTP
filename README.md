# MagicTP
The mod that makes TP like magic!

Known problems: aka ToDo

- [x] uk_ua have not silent player movement ("[Ігрок2: Телепортовано Ігрок1 на x y z]") - fixed in i113
- [ ] regular "errors" in chat (An unexpected error occured trying to execute that command) from execute side, normal for others
- [ ] lack of the extensions (like /rtp with ranges)
- [ ] Git is hard for me and I accidentally deleted commits with working sources... but because I'm lucky - I restored "pre-last" commit

Please consider to use compiled builds instead using source code to build. The source code may not work at all, like for now (except debug message that about MagicTP mod was loaded)
