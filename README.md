# MagicTP
The mod that makes TP like magic!

Known problems: aka ToDo

- [x] ~~uk_ua have not silent player movement ("[Ігрок2: Телепортовано Ігрок1 на x y z]") - fixed in i113~~
- [x] ~~regular "errors" in chat (An unexpected error occured trying to execute that command) from execute side, normal for others~~
- [ ] ~~Git is hard for me and I accidentally deleted commits with working sources... but because I'm lucky - I restored "pre-last" commit~~
- [ ] **lack of the extensions (like /rtp with ranges)**

Please consider to use compiled builds instead using source code to build. The source code may not work at all
Also, the DEVLOG.md have much more detailed tasks and the "changelog"
