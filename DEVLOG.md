# Upcoming changes:
- [ ] Test that in-game change of locale didn't break anything
- [ ] Message about untranslated locale and way to do (by creating issue request for adding the locale)
- [ ] More verbose debugging (later)
- [ ] `/rtp` with ranges (like `/rtp 12500 5` where `12500` was base coordinates and `5` was margi; margin√ó100, no floating point allowed, min `1`)
- [ ] More detailed description because of accidental thing that makes "magician" mods became more "magic" (portals makes use of the "moved magically" message)
- [ ] Allow to disable the player location disclosure
- [ ] Allow to enable and disable different parts of the MagicTP (like /rtp and other)
- [ ] Move handling of the /tp to the local
