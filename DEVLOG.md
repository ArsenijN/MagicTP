- [ ] Allow change some settings about player disclosure visually
- [ ] Add more Forge Minecraft versions (test what versions are supported)
- [ ] Workout with Fabric
- [ ] Test out the Neoforge and Quilt
- [ ] More verbose debugging (later)
- [ ] `/rtp` with ranges (like `/rtp 12500 5` where `12500` was base coordinates and `5` was margin; margin`Ã—100`, no floating point allowed, min `1`)
- [ ] make `/rtp` works with config for default /rtp behaviour 
- [ ] More detailed description because of accidental thing that makes "magician" mods became more "magic" (portals makes use of the "moved magically" message)
- [ ] Allow to enable and disable different parts of the MagicTP (like `/rtp` and other)
- [ ] Move handling of the `/tp` to the local
